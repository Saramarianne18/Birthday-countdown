## How It Works

1. **Input Validation**: The form validates birth dates to ensure they're valid and not in the future
2. **Date Calculations**: JavaScript calculates various time differences using the Date object
3. **Real-time Updates**: A countdown timer updates every second using `setInterval`
4. **Statistics Generation**: Comprehensive life statistics are calculated including:
   - Current age in multiple formats
   - Days, hours, minutes lived
   - Estimated heartbeats and breaths
   - Zodiac sign determination
   - Next birthday and milestone dates
   - Progress through the current year and life
